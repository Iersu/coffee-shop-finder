## Overview

This project I built from scratch, it involved reading through docs and a bit of googling. Overall it was a good learning experience. App gets your coordinates and uses Foursquare API to get coffee shops that are within 15km radius. Because Foursquare's API allows you to only make 50 calls a day for venue details, I put the limit to 5 coffee shops and to display just open ones.
